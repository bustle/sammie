## SAMMIE - Serverless Application Model Made Infinitely Easierâ„¢

[AWS Serverless Application Model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) is an official way to define serverless applications, provided by AWS.

There are quite a few docs to read through to understand how it works, and a handful of CLI commands to package and deploy your application each time.

sammie's purpose is to get you set up and deployed in seconds. You can then utilize to official SAM docs to modify your application's resources.

```bash
npm i -g sammie
sammie init myapp1
sammie deploy
```

This will initialize a basic SAM template, deploy it, and open a browser with your function served over https!

If you already have a SAM template, you can use `sammie deploy` for a simplified deployment.
Make sure to add the following `Parameters` to your template so sammie knows where to deploy:

```json
"Parameters": {
  "StackName": {
    "Type": "String",
    "Default": "<your-stack-name>"
  },
  "BucketName": {
    "Type": "String",
    "Default": "<your-s3-bucket-name-to-upload-code-to>"
